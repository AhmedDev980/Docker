# Docker

1. docker pull <image name>
It will connect to docker deamon in Docker HOst and then Docker Deamon will connect with Docker RegistryHub to get the image. And then it will be pulled into dockerhost

2. docker run -p 80:8080 -d <image name>
# ( local port:containerport )

# HOW TO INSTALL DOCKER AND PULL,PUSH IMAGE TO DOCKER REGISTRY HUB

1. Install docker desktop
2. check the docker version
   # docker --version
3. Create account in docker hub and login to it
   # docker login
4. After logging into docker hub we can able to pull or push the images from it by using below command for pulling image
   # docker pull <image name with tag >
5. After pulling the image check it whether it came or not
   # docker images (we will get the list of images)
6. After checking the pulled image then we can run the image
   # docker run --name <give name to the container which is going to create> -p <localport:containerport> -d <image name>
7. To get the list of containers
   # docker ps (shows running containers)
   # docker ps -a (shows all containers running and stopped )
   # docker ps -q (shows only container ID)
   # docker ps -a -f "status=exited" (shows stopped containers. -f means filter)
9. Command to connect container terminal
   # docker exec -it <container name> /bin/sh
10. Commands to start,stop,remove. (we cannot remove container without stopping)
    # docker stop <container-name>
    # docker start <container-name>
    # docker rmi <image-id> (To remove image)


# To PUSH IMAGE TO DOCKER HUB

1. Create the folder and write a docker file, index.html file ( We can take the existing nginx image and edit it as per our requirement )
2. Once docker file and index.html file was written, Build the image
   # docker build -t <dockerhub-id>/<image-name>:v1 . (. is given so that dockerfile and index.html are in current folder and will be executed from here and -t is tag)
   # docker build -t ahmed-66/mynginx-image:v1 .
3. Once after building the image, Run the image
   # docker run --name <name giving to container> -p 80:80 -d dockerhub-id>/<image-name>:v1
4. If we want to change the tag
   # docker tag dockerhub-id>/<image-name>:v1 dockerhub-id>/<image-name>:v1-release
5. Then we can push the docker image to docker hub
   # docker push dockerhub-id>/<image-name>:v1-release
